# ViewSeriesExtension

This is a simple extension for viewing multiple series of a particular patient/study combination. A list of patients is created based on the data in the Slicer DICOM Database. 
The user can then click on a patient, and a list of studies corresponding the selected patient is populated. The user can then select a study, and in the viewer, 
a view is created for each series in the study.
